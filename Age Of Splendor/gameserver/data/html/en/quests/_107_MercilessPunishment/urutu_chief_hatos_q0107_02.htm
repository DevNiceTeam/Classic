Urutu Chief Hatos:<br>
Seer Livina has sent an urgent message. She says that the <font color="LEVEL">traitor Baranka</font> is planning something suspicious! What's more, according to the scout's report, Baranka's followers are moving quickly to a new location!<br>
Anyone who finds out what the traitor is plotting, and even better, puts a stop to the scheme, will receive a great reward from me, Urutu Chief Hatos! I don't care who it is!<br>
