Defender Cromwell:<br>
Nice to meet you! I am Defender Cromwell, Guard of the Dwarven Village. <br>
Hey, I'll let you in on a little secret. If you go north from here, there's a great beach. When I am off duty, I sometimes go there and enjoy the wind. It's a good place to go with a lover, but it's nice to go alone too. <br>
