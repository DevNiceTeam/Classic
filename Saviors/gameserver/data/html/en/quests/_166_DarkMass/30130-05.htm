Abyssal Celebrant Undrias:<br>
Don't return unless you have all the items that I have asked for. Don't tell me that you have forgotten what you must bring back? I will tell you one more time, so pay attention. Get the <font color="LEVEL">ceremonial dagger</font> from <font color="LEVEL">Iria</font> of the <font color="LEVEL">weapons shop</font>, the wine from <font color="LEVEL">Dorankus</font> of the <font color="LEVEL">warehouse</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Garmiel's Scripture</font> from <font color="LEVEL">Master Trudy</font> of the <font color="LEVEL">House of Elders</font>. I hope you will not ask me again.
