Hierarch Asterios:<br>
Well done. This will be enough to research the purification magic. As soon as the magic is complete, I will travel under the protection of the sentinels to the water source and perform the purification spell, and eradicate any plague zombies that may yet remain.

My young kinsman, you have performed a great deed for our sacred <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree Glade</font> and for the <font color="LEVEL">Elven</font> race. I will give you this as a tribute to your brave deed. It may not seem like much, but it will come in handy one day, so keep it well.

May the splendor of mithril forever shine on the forest and lake!
