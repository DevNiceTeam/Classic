Sentry Jeanine:<br>
Go to <font color="LEVEL">Master Harant</font> and give him this <font color="LEVEL">letter</font>. And if he is finished with our weapon orders, please bring them here. I will give you compensation for performing this deed for us.

To meet <font color="LEVEL">Master Harant</font>, go into the village and head to the <font color="LEVEL">Sanctum of Shilen</font>, the building where the four Tetrarchs reside. Follow the cave behind me and go to the center of the village square. Then take the stairs on the right. The great building at the top of the stairs is the <font color="LEVEL">Sanctum of Shilen</font>. It is a holy place, so purify your mind before you enter.
