Herb Collector:<br>
Ah! Don't surprise me like that! I thought it was the Nymphs.<br>
Did you know that Nymphs have appeared in the Enchanted Valley? It hasn't been easy collecting herbs ever since parts of the valley transformed. <br>
And then the Nymphs are so violent... I've been doing this for 10 years, and were it not for the secret passageways I created, I would have died. <br>
Please let me know if you are going up the valley. I can show you where the passageways are.<br>
