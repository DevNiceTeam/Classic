Sentry Nelsya:<br>
In a few days the <font color="LEVEL">mass of darkness</font> dedicated to Shillien and Gran Kain will be held. <font color="LEVEL">Shillien's Hunt</font> will be held for ten days before the mass. The purpose of this ceremony is to hunt wild animals in the name of the goddess and offer them as a sacrifice at the sanctuary. Of course, the act of offering a sacrifice is only symbolic -- in the past, the hunt's purpose was also to acquire supplies for thewinter during our long period of hiding in the darkness.

During the hunt, all the youth in the village, armed with swords and bows, go out into the woods to hunt. The fervor is impressive -- the Humans who witnessed it called it a "wild hunt". I think you should definitely participate when the hunt begins. 

(Quest for characters level 3 and above.)
