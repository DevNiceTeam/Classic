Newbie Guide:<br>
At your level best to hunt <font color="LEVEL">Longtail Keltir's</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Gremlin's Scavenger</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Black Wolf's</font> in the south of the village. Do not underestimate the wolves, they are still dangerous for a novice such as you. If the south is too many other hunters, you can exit through the north gate and walk a little bit to the east. On the beach you will meet like monsters.<br>
To understand just how serious contender for you to be a monster, <font color="LEVEL">look at the color of its name</font>. At first, better to hunt monsters, the name of which is shown in green. The enemies, whose names are marked yellow or red, a lot stronger than you. Try to avoid them.<br>
And I will say in advance, at your level is better not to mess with the Orcs. It is cunning and powerful creature. Still have time to fight with them. Even with the support of friends you will be in difficulty. While you can win one, but with two you will not cope. Listen to my words, I'm not bad advice.<br>
