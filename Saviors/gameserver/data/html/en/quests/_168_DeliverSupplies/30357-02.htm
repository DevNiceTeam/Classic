Sentry Krispen:<br>
Please give my old bronze sword to <font color="LEVEL">Sentry Jeanine</font>. Outdated weapons are to be sent to <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Karrod</font>. I guess that my old sword will be melted down and used to make new weapons or armor. It's regrettable, but we cannot waste our resources at a time like this.
