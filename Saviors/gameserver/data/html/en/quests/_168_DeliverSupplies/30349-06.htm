Sentry Jeanine:<br>
Well done. I must gather our old bronze swords and send them to <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Karrod</font>. They will be used to make useful items, such as armor or shields.

Our motto is to reward even the most minuscule of tasks. Please accept this as payment for your work on behalf of my sisters and me.

May the blessings of Shilen be with you until we meet again.
