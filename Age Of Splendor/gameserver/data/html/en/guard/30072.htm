Guard Metty:<br>
Ahh... What is it?! Can't you see I'm on duty? This soldier has no time to chatter leisurely with the likes of you, country wanderer. Don’t be a nuisance. Do me a favor and disappear from my sight.<br>
Hey, country bumpkin! There is a village that suits the likes of you. If you follow this road in front of me you will come to a village called <font color="LEVEL">Floran.</font> It’s a country village that is suitable for a hillbilly like you.<br>
