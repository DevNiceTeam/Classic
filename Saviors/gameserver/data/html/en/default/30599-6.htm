Newbie Guide:<br>
I advise you to look hard at the job. The future of our race is in your hands. I'll tell you about the tasks that, in my view, will suit you. But remember that all the jobs I can not know, so always listen to the villagers.<br>
There are one-time job, but there are those that can be performed several times.<br>
