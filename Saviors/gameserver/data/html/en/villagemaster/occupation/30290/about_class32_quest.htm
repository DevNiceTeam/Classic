Grand Master Xenos:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">gaze of the abyss</font> is a token given to those who have passed the Test of the Palus Knight. The Test of the Palus Knight is conducted by <font color="LEVEL">Master Virgil</font> of the Dark Elven Guild in the <font color="LEVEL">town of Gludio</font>. Seek him out to take the test. The town of Gludio is to the east of here. The Dark Elven Guild is in the northeast part of Gludio. Of course, using a Gatekeeper is faster.<br>
