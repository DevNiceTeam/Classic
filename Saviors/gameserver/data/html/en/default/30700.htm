Master Prestan:<br>
You will soon find out what an exciting place this village is. At least for people who know how to enjoy themselves, there will be many amusing things for them. Hmm, death, hidden at the other side of the bustling. It is what all Dark Elves crave...<br>
How about you? Ready to enjoy? Then pick up your weapon. Now! Shall we begin the hunting festival?<br>
