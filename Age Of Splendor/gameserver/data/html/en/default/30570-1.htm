Prefect Karukia:<br>
Our tribe, Atuba, inherited the blood of the wolf! Wolves are our brothers and the guardian spirits that protect us! Wolves have been our symbol for a long time.<br>
Other Orc tribes have their own symbols. The gray bear for the Hestui, the bat for the Neruga, the skeleton of an Orc for the Urutu, the spider for the Duda-Mara, and the monster eye for the Gandi.<br>
