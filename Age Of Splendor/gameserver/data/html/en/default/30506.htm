Bow respectfully to the name of the flame!!<br>
I greet you! I am the trainer of the flame! I was sent to Gludio Castle Town, and I am in charge of cultivating the noble spirit of the Orc. You will see many Orcs throughout the world who abandoned their pride, honor, and privilege, and live like worms. Turek, Enku, and Vuku are some examples! They should be cursed!! How can they abandon the lofty spirit of the flame and degrade themselves!! You should never forget what happened to them, and make every effort to prevent it from ever happening again.<br>
