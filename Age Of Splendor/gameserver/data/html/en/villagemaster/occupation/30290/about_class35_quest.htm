Grand Master Xenos:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">steel heart</font> is only given to those who pass the Test of the Assassin. <font color="LEVEL">Triskel</font> is in charge of that test. He is a great Dark Elf, who has been an Assassin himself for a long time. He is always near the Dark Elven guild in the <font color="LEVEL">town of Gludio</font>, so you will easily find him once you get there. You can get to the town of Gludio by following the road to the east. Of course, using a Gatekeeper is much easier.<br>
