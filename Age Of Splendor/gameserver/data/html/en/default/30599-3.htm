Newbie Guide:<br>
Most likely, you got two types of weapons. A dagger and one academic knightly sword. You probably already noticed how much they differ from each other. <font color="LEVEL">Dagger</font> is fast, but it has a low accuracy, <font color="LEVEL">Training Sword Knight (one-handed sword)</font> slower, but has a high accuracy. Use the weapons, which is more suitable for you. When will type 5000 Aden, you can change the dagger on a <font color="LEVEL">Bone Dagger</font> and a sword in the <font color="LEVEL">Short Sword</font>.<br>
Armor is usually mined in battles with monsters, but if to achieve level 5 you will not find anything, you can buy them in the shop.<br>
