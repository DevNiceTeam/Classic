Newbie Guide:<br>
Based on your level, you have to hunt for <font color="LEVEL">Shining Keltir's</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Elder Shining Keltir's</font>, or <font color="LEVEL">Kasha Wolf</font> north-west of the village. Do not underestimate the wolves, they are still dangerous for a novice such as you. To find them is not difficult. It is enough to walk down the hill outside the village in the north or the south.
To understand just how serious contender for you to be a monster, <font color="LEVEL">look at the color of its name</font>. At first, better to hunt monsters, the name of which is shown in green. The enemies, whose names are marked yellow or red, a lot stronger than you. Try to avoid them.<br>
And I will say in advance on the level of 3-4 is better not to mess with the Goblin's. It is cunning and powerful creature. Still have time to fight with them. Even with the support of friends you will be in difficulty. While you can win one, but with two you will not cope. Listen to my words, I'm not bad advice.<br>
