Harin:<br>
Nice to meet you. I am a mage called Hardin. People say a lot of things about me but what do you think after seeing me directly? I'm different than ordinary mages, no?<br>
I'm a graduate of the Ivory Tower but I had some doubts about the elitism there. Well... It may have just been foolishness during my younger days, but... Anyway, I did a lot of thinking at that time...<br>
So, let me know if you're curious about anything. This academy is open to everyone. However, please understand that instruction in magic is given only to my pupils...<br>
