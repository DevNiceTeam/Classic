<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Walderal:<br>
In running a warehouse, I sometimes stumble across other people's secrets...completely by accident, you know. A few days ago, for example, a nobleman whose name I cannot reveal deposited a cute little rag doll! It was fairly well made, I suppose, but certainly not even worth the deposit fee. What do you think it means? Ha ha...<br>
