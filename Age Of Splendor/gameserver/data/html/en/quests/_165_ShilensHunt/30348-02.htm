Sentry Nelsya:<br>
In a few days the <font color="LEVEL">mass of darkness</font> dedicated to Shillien and Gran Kain will be held. <font color="LEVEL">Shillien's Hunt</font> will be held for ten days before the mass.
The purpose of this ceremony is to hunt wild animals in the name of the goddess and offer them as a sacrifice at the sanctuary.
Of course, the act of offering a sacrifice is only symbolic -- in the past, the hunt's purpose was also to acquire supplies
for thewinter during our long period of hiding in the darkness.

The hunt has already begun! The youth of the village are in the woods and on the hunt, armed with swords and bows.
The fervor is impressive -- the Humans who witnessed it called it the "wild hunt." I think you should also hurry and
participate inthe hunt to honor the mother of the abyss!
