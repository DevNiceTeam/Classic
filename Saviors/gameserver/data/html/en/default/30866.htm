<html><head>Prefect Marestella:<br>
Us Orcs have come to Aden following the request of the king of the weak Humans. At any age, Orcs like it for Humans to regret their mistakes and express sincerity to Orcs but is this really the case now? In order to avoid being abused yet again by wily humans, everybody is going to have to pay attention.<br>
Haven't we been terribly disappointed with the creatures called Humans in the past?!<br>
I am Prefect Marestella and I will be the eye of the prefect of fire watching over Humans in the capital city of the Human kingdom.<br>
