Hunter Union Member Colin:<br>
Hey! I think I've seen you before. What brings you to the Hunters' Union?<br>
Are you here to join the Union? Because our union isn't accepting new members, or are you here for something else?  Ask about anything. I, Colin will answer your questions with the most respect.<br>
