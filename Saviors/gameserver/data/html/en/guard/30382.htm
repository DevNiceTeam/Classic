Guard Leikan:<br>
If you follow this road northeast, you will come to the Grim Ruins. Originally, it was the village of Bernice, where I was born, but it was reduced to ashes by the war. If you see its ghastly state, you will understand why it's now called the <font color="LEVEL">Grim Ruins.</font><br>
If you pass the ruins and continue north, you will arrive at the <font color="LEVEL">forest where the Dark Elves live</font>. Although I've never gone there myself... Travelers say that it is dark and eerie in a very unnatural way. <br>
