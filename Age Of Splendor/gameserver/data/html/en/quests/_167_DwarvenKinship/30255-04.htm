I guess it can't be helped. I must ask someone else, I suppose ...

Oh, please take this before you go! It's not much, but think of it as a token of thanks for delivering <font color="LEVEL">Collette's letter</font>. It is more than enough money to cover your travel expenses from the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elven village</font> to here.

Goodbye, then. May the protection of the Earth be with you!
