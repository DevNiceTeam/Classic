Guard Xaber:<br>
Hey, stranger. If you are going to Giran, don’t wander off this road along the way. If you leave the path for a even moment, you could suffer an unlucky mishap with the <font color="LEVEL">runaway troops.</font> They are wicked and violent criminals, so before you leave, go to the temple and pray to Einhasad that you never meet them.<br>
