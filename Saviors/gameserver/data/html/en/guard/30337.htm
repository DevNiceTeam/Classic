Guard Moretti:<br>
Greetings! You may think it is boring to stand guard here all day, but it is always enjoyable having a word or two with travelers. Especially when I stand guard here at the west gate, I frequently meet the Elves from the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Forest.</font> I’m used to it now, but I was really fascinated the first time I saw an Elf...<br>
