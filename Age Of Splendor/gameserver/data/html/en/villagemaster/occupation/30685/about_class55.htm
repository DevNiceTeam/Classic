A Bounty Hunter is just like a Scavenger but an advanced version. He has better gathering skills and stronger stamina. Obtaining unique items that no one can get from a monster is the best feature of a Bounty Hunter.<br>
A Bounty Hunter's skill is very similar to a Scavenger, for instance, collecting additional items from the corpses of monsters are the main skills they use. Plus they can act dead during emergencies and carry out strong strikes with blunts.<br>
To be a Bounty Hunter, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Guildsman, the Mark of Prosperity, and the Mark of the Searcher.<br>
