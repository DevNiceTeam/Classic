Lighthouse Keeper Rockswel:<br>
Long ago, they say they sacrificed virgins to the sea, but times have changed and there is no sailor who keeps this tradition. Instead, we set afloat a boat that contains a doll in the shape of a Human maiden. Now we have to make that doll.

I've asked <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Rolfe</font>, who is handy with his hands, to make the doll, but we still have to make the doll's long hair. For that, I need high quality <font color="LEVEL">fur yarn</font>.

Hunt the <font color="LEVEL">keltirs</font> on the island and gather about ten bundles of fur, then take them to <font color="LEVEL">Cristel</font> in the next village. You can find her at the well in <font color="LEVEL">front of the village warehouse</font>. Give the fur to <font color="LEVEL">Cristel</font>, and she will spin it into yarn. Take the yarn and give it to <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Rolfe</font>. He will probably finish the doll on the spot. As soon as the <font color="LEVEL">doll</font> is finished, bring it back to me. I will give you generous reward for your labor.
