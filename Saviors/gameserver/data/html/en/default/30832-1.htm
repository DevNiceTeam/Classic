Are you talking about this cave which is used as the academy? It's not inconvenient for the use of my pupils and me. Are you thinking it's a little rustic? It would be better for you to go ask Sir Lich King Icarus for more details. That's because he was the original owner here.<br>
I'm the second or third... I met him while wandering around after having left the side of my master... and I took possession of this cave after winning a competition. Until then, he used this cave as his base but it seems that he was doing a lot of bad things. Well, he's not really someone that can boast about any particular accomplishments and so I can't really tell you too much about what bad actions he committed. Ha, ha...<br>
