Sentry Jeanine:<br>
I see that you have not delivered the <font color="LEVEL">swords</font> to my sisters yet. Please deliver the weapons to Sentries <font color="LEVEL">Roselyn</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Krispen</font> and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">old bronze swords</font> they have been using.

</font>Roselyn</font> is standing guard at the entrance of the village. You can reach her by going through the cave behind me. And <font color="LEVEL">Krispen</font> is on duty at the village entrance opposite <font color="LEVEL">Roselyn</font>.
