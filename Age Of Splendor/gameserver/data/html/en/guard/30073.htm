Guard Jacob:<br>
How do you do, honored traveler? Have you come to our village to see the great shell of <font color="LEVEL">cruma</font>? If you have, then you'd be well advised to give up your search. Many have come to this village to view the shell of cruma, but I have rarely seen anyone return from that place intact. The <font color="LEVEL">Marshlands</font> where the shell of cruma lies have for ages been a place teeming with monsters -- even our guards don't like to go near there.<br>
